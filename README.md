# dev.connexion

[Frontend Repository](https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/ffprac-team1-front/)

> The back-end server will be running on port 8000.
> The front-end app will be running on port 3000.
> You will need to run both the back-end server and the front-end app at the same time to test your app.

### Setting up local development environment

1. Create a folder to contain both the front-end and back-end repos
2. Clone this repository to that folder
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Pull the latest version of the `main` branch (when needed)
5. Add .env file
6. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
7. Open http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ with your browser to test.
8. Your back-end server is now running. You can now run the front-end app.
